## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-Time Recognition:** Processes live webcam feed with low latency for instant gesture translation.
- **Multi-Gesture Support:** Recognizes all letters (A-Z) and common words/phrases like "I LOVE U", "BEST", "WHAT", "CUP".
- **Data Collection Utility:** Built-in tool for capturing and preprocessing custom gesture datasets.
- **CNN Model:** Powered by a Convolutional Neural Network for high-accuracy image classification.
- **Robust Hand Detection:** Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and isolation.
- **Optimized Pipeline:** Engineered for performance to meet real-time constraints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Bhumika987/Real-Time-ASL-Recognition.git
cd Real-Time-ASL-Recognition

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: You should create a simple `requirements.txt` file with this content:)*
```
opencv-python
numpy
tensorflow
cvzone
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Live ASL Recognition
Run the main application to translate gestures in real-time.
```bash
python test.py
```

### 2. Data Collection
Use the utility script to capture images and build your own dataset.
```bash
python main.py
# Press 's' key to save an image of the current gesture.
```

## üìä Model Performance

- **Latency:** Achieves <200ms end-to-end prediction on standard hardware.
- **Accuracy:** High classification accuracy on trained gestures.
- **Supported Gestures:** 32+ classes including alphabet and common phrases.
